#   Objective: Clustering of Iris Dataset
From the given 'iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Algorithm used K-Means
K-Means is centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm , where we calculate the distanced to assign a point to cluster
In k-Means , each cluster is associed with a centroid.
Workflow behind implementation of K-Means Clustering
1. Choose the number of cluster
2. Select K random points from the data as centroids
3. Assign all points to the closes cluster centroids
4. Recompute the centroides of newly formed clusters
